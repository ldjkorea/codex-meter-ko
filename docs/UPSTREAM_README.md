# Codex Meter

Codex Meter is an unofficial open-source client for viewing the Codex allowance
attached to a signed-in ChatGPT account. This repository is a **monorepo**:

| Path | Platform | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|
| Repository root | Shared | Docs, license, changelog, CI, convenience script wrappers |
| [`android/`](android/) | **Android** | Phone app + Wear companion: One UI dashboard, home widgets, Samsung lock/AOD, notifications, optional live usage monitor |
| [`ios/`](ios/) | **iPhone / iPad** | Native SwiftUI + WidgetKit client with portable 2.8.0 behavior (meters, monthly Free-tier windows, history analytics, diagnostics, widgets) |

There is no shared backend. Each platform talks to ChatGPT/Codex endpoints
directly and stores credentials only on-device.

## Android — Version 2.8.0

Version 2.8.0 adapts to Free-tier monthly Codex limits when a paid plan expires, adds opt-in diagnostic log tracing/export, and declutters usage-history analytics with customizable highlights. This stable release consolidates the 2.8.0-alpha.1 channel build; alpha remains opt-in under Settings → Updates → Update channel.

On compatible Galaxy Watches, those five standard AndroidX Tiles also advertise Samsung's private modular-card hints: the overview requests a 2×2 footprint and the focused usage, reset, and monitor Tiles request 2×1 footprints. Their diagonal One UI gradient cards use the same rounded 228-degree usage-dial geometry and One UI Sans typography as the phone's battery-style widgets. Other Wear OS tile hosts ignore the sizing hints and keep the normal full-screen carousel presentation. Samsung does not document third-party eligibility for modular placement, so final grid behavior remains firmware-dependent.

### Live countdowns

Samsung lock-screen widgets can display the remaining time until each usage window resets. The countdown is driven locally by Android `Chronometer` views using the reset timestamp already cached from the usage response; it does not repeatedly contact the server merely to update seconds or minutes.

### Live usage monitor

Settings includes an optional, user-started live usage monitor that runs only until the next available usage reset. It shows the real five-hour and weekly allowance values, marks a missing window as unavailable, and refreshes whenever the app receives new usage data. Android 16 can promote the notification as a Live Update, while compatible Samsung firmware can also surface it in the Now Bar. The monitor can be stopped at any time and is cleared when the user signs out.

### Reset alerts

Users can choose silent, notification-sound, or alarm-sound alerts for the five-hour limit, weekly limit, or both. Alerts can be conditional on the most recently observed allowance being below a selected threshold. Android schedules the notification for the cached reset time and performs a normal background refresh after the alert fires.

### Widget surfaces

The app includes:

- Responsive home-screen widgets with ring, four-dial, and battery-list layouts, plus Adaptive / Dials / Progress bars layout preference and drag-reorderable meter slots (Codex 5-hour/weekly, next reset, reset credits).
- Both-window, five-hour-only, and weekly-only configurations (legacy metric mode; meters checklist supersedes this when customized).
- Optional reset-credit inventory, expiration, and redemption controls.
- Transparent through opaque backgrounds, including a Background off toggle and three One UI-style opacity steps.
- Samsung One UI presentation throughout the dashboard, settings, and widget configuration surfaces.
- Samsung lock/AOD providers for both usage windows together or dedicated five-hour and weekly views.
- High-resolution supersampled lock-screen geometry with native Android text overlays.
- Optional live time-to-reset labels on supported lock-screen hosts.

## Authentication and data handling

- Browser-based ChatGPT sign-in using OAuth authorization code + PKCE and a localhost loopback callback.
- Access-token refresh with refresh-token rotation preservation.
- Android Keystore AES-GCM encryption for locally stored tokens.
- Usage and reset-credit retrieval from the ChatGPT backend routes used by Codex.
- No analytics, advertisements, WebView, or application-level relay server.

## Compatibility

- Phone minimum Android 8.0 (API 26); Wear companion minimum API 30
- Phone compile SDK Android 16 (API 36); Wear compile SDK Android 17 (API 37.0)
- Phone and Wear target Android 16 (API 36)
- Universal DEX APK with no native ABI libraries
- Standard Android home-screen widgets
- Private Samsung One UI lock/AOD integration on compatible Galaxy firmware

## Build from source

### Android

See [`android/README.md`](android/README.md). The Android project uses Gradle with the OneUI-Design and oneui-icons libraries so its dashboards use Samsung-style SESL components, typography, and iconography.

Requirements:

- JDK 17 or newer
- Android SDK Platforms 36 and 37.0
- Android Build Tools 36.x
- `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` or `ANDROID_HOME` configured
- A GitHub Packages token in `GH_ACCESS_TOKEN` (with `read:packages`) and your username in `GH_USERNAME` when the OneUI-Design dependencies are not already cached

From the repository root:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
./build.sh
```

Or from `android/` directly. `build.sh` assembles the release APKs with Gradle and signs them with a local development key under `android/.local-signing/`. Those locally signed APKs will not install over the distributed release build. Artifacts land in `android/dist/`.

### iOS

See [`ios/README.md`](ios/README.md). Requires Xcode 26+ and iOS/iPadOS 26+.
The iOS client now carries portable Android 2.8.0 behavior: Free-tier monthly
windows, scrubbable usage-history analytics with customize, and opt-in
diagnostic log export.

```bash
cd ios
swift test --package-path CodexMeterCore
xcodebuild -project CodexMeter.xcodeproj -scheme CodexMeter \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

## Releases

Creating a `v*` tag that matches the Gradle `versionName` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (for example `v2.6.5`) runs the full CI pipeline and publishes the signed phone APK, signed Wear OS APK, and their SHA-256 checksums to GitHub Releases. CI authenticates and decrypts the persistent PKCS#12 release keystore `android/ci/release-keystore.p12.enc` (alias `codexmeter`) using the `ANDROID_SIGNING_PASSWORD` repository Actions secret, so every release is signed with the same certificate and installs in place over previous releases. Release notes are taken from the root `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Platform stability

The ChatGPT usage and reset-credit routes and Samsung's lock-screen metadata are implementation details rather than stable third-party Android SDK contracts. OpenAI or Samsung may change eligibility, routing, response fields, host behavior, or private metadata.
